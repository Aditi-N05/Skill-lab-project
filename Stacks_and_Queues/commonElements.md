# Common Elements in Three Sorted Arrays

## Problem Statement

Given three sorted arrays in **non-decreasing order**, print all **common elements** across these arrays, also in **non-decreasing order**. If there are no such elements, return `-1`.

### **Note:**
- You **must not use any additional data structure** to handle duplicates.
- The solution should run in **O(n + m + p)** time, where `n`, `m`, and `p` are the lengths of the three arrays.

## **Examples**

### **Example 1:**
#### **Input:**
```plaintext
arr1 = [1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80]
arr2 = [6, 7, 20, 80, 100]
arr3 = [3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120]

# Value equal to index value

Given an array _arr_. Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value **(Consider 1-based indexing)**.

__Note:__ There can be more than one element in the array which have the same value as its index. You need to include every such element's index. Follows 1-based indexing of the array.

# Constraints:
1. 1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 10 <sup>5</sup>
2. 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10 <sup>6</sup>
